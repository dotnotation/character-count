# character-count
JS algorithm following Colt Steele's Udemy course

The goal is to return an object with a key value pair of the number of each alphanumeric character in a string. If the string is "Hello" we want the return to be {h: 1, e: 1, l: 2, o: 1}. We want to lower case everything as we are not separating out the characters by upper or lower case.
